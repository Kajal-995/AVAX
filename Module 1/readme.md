# AvaxTest Smart Contract
# Description
AvaxTest is a simple Solidity smart contract that demonstrates the usage of require(), assert(), and revert() statements. The contract allows users to call three different functions, each showcasing a different statement, to handle conditions and exceptions during the execution of the contract.

# License

# Prerequisites
To interact with this smart contract, you will need an Ethereum wallet or a development environment with a compatible Solidity compiler (version 0.8.0 or higher).

# Usage
Deploy the AvaxTest contract to an Ethereum-compatible blockchain or network of your choice.

Once deployed, you can interact with the contract by calling the following functions:

# testRequire(uint256 x)
This function checks if the provided value x is greater than 10. If the condition is not met, the function call will be reverted, and no changes will be made to the contract state. If the condition is satisfied, the contract's num variable will be updated with the value of x.

# testAssert(uint256 x)
This function checks if the provided value x is greater than 5 using the assert() statement. If the condition is false, the transaction will be reverted, and any gas used until that point will not be refunded. If the condition is true, the contract's num variable will be updated with the value of x.

# testRevert(uint256 x)
This function checks if the provided value x is greater than 15. If the condition is true, the function will explicitly revert the transaction with a custom error message "The value of x is greater than 15." If the condition is false, the function will complete normally, and no changes will be made to the contract state.

Use an Ethereum wallet or a development environment with a web3 provider to call the functions and observe their behavior.

# Important Notes
Ensure that you provide valid input parameters when calling the functions to avoid unexpected behavior or transaction reverts.
Take into consideration that using the assert() statement is suitable for internal checks that should never be false, while require() should be used for input validation and conditions that must hold true for the function to proceed.
The revert() statement is used for explicit transaction reverts and allows you to provide a custom error message, helping users understand why their transactions were reverted.
Remember to manage gas costs when interacting with the contract, as reverts and assert failures consume all the gas provided for the transaction until the point of failure.
